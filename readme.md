Vertx Extensions
================

This is just a project that helps me extend vertx in ways I need it. People are free to use it as is or contribute I do not mind.

Notes
=====
* I would like the vertx HttpServerResponse's generics to support anything that extends HttpServerResponse. This would make it easy for me to write a DSL as needed to create responses instean of wrapping the HttpServerResponse in a Responder.

Everything here will be moved into proper projects once I have stopped playing with the ideas and think they are work implementing.
